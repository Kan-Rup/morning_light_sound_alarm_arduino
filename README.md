Copyright Â© Kanishka Rupasinghe , 2021 onward

This code works when uploaded to the arduino board of the morning-light-alarm circuit.

The alarm circuit starts beeping at the first light of the day at dawn. 
The alarm is activated at a specific level of light, and increases in the frequency of
beeping as the light levels increase.
